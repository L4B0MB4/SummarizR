{"summary":"Two powerful earthquakes of magnitudes 7.4 and 7.9 shook the southeastern part of Turkey early Monday morning. Numerous buildings collapsed and the Interior Minister reported casualties. 22 aftershocks occurred with some of them being strong. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan tweeted “We hope to overcome this catastrophe together in the shortest amount of time and with minimal damage”. The extent of the disaster is yet to be determined. Turkey is often affected by severe earthquakes due to the two major continental plates it borders, the African and Eurasian plates. Most of the Turkish population lives in constant danger of earthquakes.","originalUrl":"https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/tuerkei-schwere-erdbeben-an-grenze-zu-syrien-tote-und-verletzte-a-9db53f3f-4cf8-4f91-998b-7a6fd1ddfa8c"}
