{"summary":"Global Societies is a 3-year project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that involves journalists reporting on global injustices, societal challenges and sustainable development in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe. Features, analyses, photo essays, videos and podcasts appear in DER SPIEGEL's Foreign Desk section and Global Societies section of the DER SPIEGEL International website. The project is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, but does not influence the content. Similar projects are being funded by the foundation for other media outlets such as The Guardian and El Pa√≠s. DER SPIEGEL has also worked with the Gates Foundation and the European Journalism Centre on two projects: \"Expedition BeyondTomorrow\" and \"The New Arrivals\". All Global Societies pieces are published in the Globale Gesellschaft section of the DER SPIEGEL website and a selection is available in English on the DER SPIEGEL International website.","originalUrl":"https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/lithium-bonanza-china-battles-west-for-raw-material-of-the-future-a-b88a3948-26e8-47d6-ac34-d632bc7f0945"}
