# SummarizR

## What is this ? 
Its a quick and dirty build project that accesses the SPIEGEL headlines and gets their contents, then give them to a language model and let it create a summary of those.
Afterwards creating a file in "contents" of what it generated and a html structure to view in the website mentioned above
